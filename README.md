# Basic Guess Game

## Introduction
- This basic **JavaScript** game prompts the user to guess a random number between 1 and 5 (*customizable*) until they run out of available numbers.
- It also displays the number of attempts it took for the user to guess the correct number.

## Key Learning Concepts
- Demonstrates the use and understanding of data types, as well as common control structures like `for` loops and `if-else` statements.
- Helped me learn JavaScript syntax and logical structures, including ternary operators and how to define custom functions.
- I also gained an understanding of how JavaScript interacts with HTML using various built-in methods.

## Personal Notes
This project is primarily for myself. I want to revisit it in 4, 5, 6, or even 12 months to see how much Iâ€™ve progressed. It was my introductory project in JavaScript.
